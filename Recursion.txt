(1) When we apply recursion ?
ans. -> when situation of Try All The Possible Ways and in this count ways or best(max or min) type problem occurs
            then we apply recursion

(2) Trick for recurance realation in recursion.
step -> 1: Try to represent the problem in term of index if array probelm then ok but for other problems represent 
           in index.
step -> 2: Do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement.
step -> 3: sum up all sutffs -> if question says count all ways 
           take minimum of all stuffs -> if question says find minimum
           take maximum of all stuffs -> if question says find maximum


(3) Whenever you are using recursion in code you should have confidence that the recursion can do all the 
things and you have to solve only one sub-problem which is the top most sub-problem.

(4) Returning value of recursion: what the value the recursion is returning.

Important point for recursion:
    (I) Focus on that one subproblem and faith that all other subproblems are solved by recursion.
    (II) If recursion is returning any vlaue then you should konw what the value is recursion ius returning.
