m = 10 ^ 9 + 7

(1) a + b => (a + b) % m
(2) a - b => (a - b + m) % m 
(3) a * b => (a * b) % m or ((a % m) * (b % m)) % m
(4) (a / b) % m => (a * (b) ^ (m-2)) % m
(5) A^B % m => (I) if >>> A i.e. value of A is large and it can be bigger then mod value
                then u can do this.
                (A^B) % m => ((A%m) * (A%m) * (A%m)) % m 
                I mean u can run a loop and for each itration u can multiply by and take mod

                (II) if >>> B then just do this and it can be proved in farmet little theoremf
                (A^B) % m => A^(B % (m-1)) 

Imp Points
(I) When we subtracrt two number and we have to find mod also so in that case it might 
    be possible that subtraction can be negative and if we take mod of negative number 
    then it will give us a negative number so to avoid this problem we always add mod 
    with subtraction but keep in mind one thing if a and b r in the rage of 10^18 i.e.
    a <= 10^18 and b <= 10^8 and ur m = 10^9 + 7 so in this case might be possible that 
    after ading mod u also get the negative value so handle those cases properly

(II) In multiplication if the range is such that a <= 10^18 and b <= 10^18 then first u
    have to make sure a and b should be less then mod m for that before multiplication take
    mod of a and b such that 
    a * b => ((a % m) * (b * m)) % m

(III) In division u can't do direct division then mod and for division u have to find fisrt 
    multiplicative invers and then u can perform mod. But if ur mod m is prime number then u
    can do this way
    (a / b) % m => (a * (b)^(m-2)) % m
